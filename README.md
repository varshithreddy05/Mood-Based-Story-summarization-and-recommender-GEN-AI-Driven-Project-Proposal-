üéôÔ∏è MOOD-BASED-STORY-SUMMARIZATION-AND-RECOMMENDER-AI-COMPANION-FOR-KUKU-FM

üîç Project Overview

This project introduces a generative AI-powered feature for Kuku FM that transforms audio stories into personalized, mood-aligned summaries and recommendations. By combining speech-to-text, mood detection, and advanced summarization, it aims to boost user engagement and retention through real-time, emotionally intelligent content delivery.

üõ†Ô∏è Key Features

- **Mood Detection:** Analyzes both user voice tone and text sentiment to determine mood (happy, sad, excited, etc.).
- **AI Summarization:** Generates creative, 30-second story summaries using state-of-the-art models (BART, LSA, LLaMA-3-70B).
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Matches user mood with story mood for relevant suggestions.
- **Voice Interaction:** Users can request content by speaking or typing their mood.
- **Seamless Experience:** One-tap transition from summary to full audiobook.
- **Dynamic Playlists:** Curates ‚ÄúMood of the Day‚Äù playlists and adapts in real-time to user behavior.

|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Mood Analysis     | Whisper, Custom CNN, DistilBERT, Librosa            | User voice clips, search queries            |
| Content Generation| BART, LSA, Groq (LLaMA-3-70B)                       | Kuku FM audiobook library, genre tags       |
| Personalization   | Sentence-BERT, PyTorch                              | Listening history, skip rates               |

üìä Results & Metrics

- +20% average session length (22 mins ‚Üí 26.4 mins)
- +15% weekly app opens (8 ‚Üí 9.2)
- 40% click-through rate on AI-generated summaries
- 25% conversion from summary to full audiobook
- <500 ms mood detection latency
- 95% language identification accuracy (Hindi/English/Tamil)

‚úÖ Key Takeaways

- Personalized, mood-aligned recommendations reduce content mismatch and decision fatigue.
- Instant, AI-generated story hooks increase engagement and retention.
- Voice-controlled, real-time interaction enhances user experience.
- Phased rollout and use of existing Kuku FM infrastructure ensure feasibility and scalability.
- Strategic alignment with business goals-projected to reduce recommendation mismatch by 60% and drive premium upsells.

üöÄ Implementation Roadmap

- **Phase 1 (6 weeks):** Develop AI pipeline, fine-tune summarization models, build hybrid recommender.
- **Phase 2 (4 weeks):** Integrate in-app voice commands and summary-to-audiobook UI.
- **Phase 3:** Feedback loop using PySpark for continuous improvement (analyzing skips, replays, mood-genre conversions).
